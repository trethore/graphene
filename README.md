# Graphene

Graphene is a client-side UI library for Minecraft 1.21.11 (Fabric) that lets mod developers build interfaces with web technologies.
It embeds Chromium through JCEF, so you can render HTML/CSS/JavaScript UIs in-game while keeping a clean Java API for mod integration.

## What is this ?

Graphene is meant to bridge Minecraft modding and modern web UI development.

Instead of writing every screen directly with Minecraft rendering primitives, you can:

- build rich, responsive interfaces using browser capabilities;
- connect those interfaces to your mod logic through Graphene's API;
- iterate on UI faster with familiar web tooling and patterns;
- keep the integration focused on Fabric + Minecraft 1.21.11.

In short: Graphene gives Fabric mods a practical way to use web-powered interfaces without reinventing a full UI stack inside the game.
