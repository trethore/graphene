# Installation

This page is intentionally a placeholder for now.
Graphene is not publicly released yet, so official dependency coordinates and consumption steps are pending.

## Status

- Publishing target: GitHub Packages (planned)
- Stable install instructions: pending first public release
- Versioning policy docs: pending

## Placeholder Sections (To Be Filled)

### 1) Repository + Credentials

TODO: add exact Maven/Gradle repository block and authentication requirements.

### 2) Dependency Coordinates

TODO: add official `group:artifact:version` coordinates for Graphene.

### 3) Fabric + Minecraft Compatibility Matrix

TODO: add tested combinations (Minecraft, Fabric Loader, Fabric API, Java).

### 4) Minimal Consumer Setup

TODO: add a copy/paste `build.gradle(.kts)` sample and `fabric.mod.json` notes.

### 5) Verification Steps

TODO: add a simple runtime smoke checklist (`GrapheneCore.init()`, open a web view, verify bridge ready).

## Current Repository Baseline

Until public release docs are published, this repository currently targets:

- Minecraft: `1.21.11`
- Fabric Loader: `0.18.4`
- Fabric API: `0.141.3+1.21.11`
- Java: `25`

These values come from the project build configuration and may change before first public release.
